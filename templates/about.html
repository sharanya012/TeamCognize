        <h2>How Car Insurance Works:</h2>
        <p>Car insurance requires the policyholder to pay an initial premium for coverage. The deductible is a fixed amount the insured must pay out-of-pocket for repairs before the insurer covers the remaining costs. The deductible is usually chosen by the user at the time of purchasing the policy, with lower deductibles resulting in higher premiums and vice versa.</p>

        <h2>Initial Costs Involved:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premium:</strong> Paid annually or semi-annually, depending on vehicle value, location, and coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Deductible:</strong> Fixed at ₹5,000 to ₹15,000 based on user choice during policy purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Detailed Case Study to Explain Deductible and Claim Settlement:</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You pay a ₹40,000 premium for comprehensive insurance with a ₹10,000 deductible.</p>
        <p><strong>Accident Repair Cost:</strong> ₹70,000.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Payment:</strong> ₹10,000 (deductible).</p>
        <p><strong>Insurer Payment:</strong> ₹60,000.</p>
        <p>If the repair cost was ₹8,000, you would pay the entire amount, as it is below your deductible.</p>
